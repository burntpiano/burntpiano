## Hello, I'm Rory â˜»
The handle burntpiano came from an album I enjoyed as a child, but also it sounds cool.

I am a tech enthusiast. Embedded, RISC-V, x86-64, MIPS, etc. Whatever. If it blinks I'll want to take it apart. I am currently  enrolled at Fort Hays State University for web and mobile development. Before this year, I had never coded, and so far I enjoy it with caveats (who doesn't have caveats?).

Working on projects, or even having them on the backburner is how I have operated for years. I am always busy, always doing something.

Here's an incomplete list of projects I have completed (or mangled) thus far:
<ul>
  <li>OpenWRT on a pi, powering my home network. The brains of it all.</li>
  <li>A home server where I store my Linux ISOs, family photos, backups, and other stuff I don't want to pay a cloud provider for.</li>
  <li>Repaired two mechanically failed backwards compatible Playstation 3 units, for fun.</li>
  <li>Two MagicMirrors so far.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>One has had 3 revisions thus far. A Raspberry Pi 3, to a broken netbook, and currently is now using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.</li>
      <li>A 10+ year old HP Stream 7, with an Intel Bay Trail CPU (64bit CPU/32bit bootloader).</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Fixed a dumpster 70in "smart TV" timing control board with scotch tape.</li>
  <li>Attempted to remove a BIOS lock on a P52 Thinkpad Laptop an Ebay seller failed <em>conveniently</em>to disclose <br /><strong>Read:</strong> <em>I broke it</em></li>
  <li>(Successfully) Repaired my current P52 Thinkpad with a fan swap.</li>
</ul>

Currently, I am *kind of* working on:
<ul>
  <li>Repairing the same dumpster TV</li>
  <li>Attempting to port OpenWRT to a TP-Link Deco x60v2.6</li>
  <li>A <em>third</em> MagicMirror ;)</li>
  <li>Tending to my garden</li>
  <li>A grocery store sales data web scraper</li>
  <li>Raising a lovely family</li>
  <li><s>Repairing my first P52 Laptop</s> lol</li>
  <li><code>Holding broken packages!</code></li>
</ul>

I will get around to doing "post mortem" writeups on these to the best of my ability. Fortunately, I take pictures frequently to show friends. As a result, I do have *some* evidence of my ~~misdoings~~ projects. Keep your peepers peeled for any writeups or new Python/HTML/whatever projects!
