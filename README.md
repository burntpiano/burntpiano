## Hello, I'm Rory ☻

<p>
    Hi, I'm Rory — a father, a husband, and a tech enthusiast currently pursuing a degree in Informatics at Fort Hays State University. 
    I transferred in with full general education credits and am now focused on their Web and Mobile Development program, with an emphasis on full stack engineering.

    My interest in technology started when I was a kid, but it wasn’t until 2020 that I began treating it as a serious career path. 
    That shift led me to formal education and a deeper focus on development and systems design.

<p>
    Though still early in my academic and professional journey, I’m driven, adaptable, and committed to producing work that reflects the depth of my curiosity and the standards I set for myself. 
    I learn quickly, take feedback seriously, and approach every challenge as a problem waiting to be solved.
